 * @title PaymentSplitter Factory
 * @author [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @notice Factory for deploying PaymentSplitter instances as minimal proxies
 * @dev Uses OpenZeppelin Clones (ERC-1167) for gas-efficient deployments
 *
 *      DEPLOYMENT PATTERN:
 *      - Minimal proxy (EIP-1167): ~50k gas vs ~300k for full deployment
 *      - All splitters delegate to single implementation
 *      - Each deployment tracked for deployer
 *
 *      FEATURES:
 *      - Deterministic addresses via CREATE2
 *      - Deployment tracking per deployer
 *      - Payee name labels for identification
 *      - Sweep function for rescue operations
