/// @title RegenStakerBase
/// @author [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
/// @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
/// @custom:origin https://github.com/ScopeLift/staker
/// @notice Base contract for RegenStaker variants, extending the Staker contract by [ScopeLift](https://scopelift.co).
/// @notice Provides shared functionality including:
///         - Variable reward duration (7-3000 days, configurable by admin)
///         - Earning power management with external bumping incentivized by tips (up to maxBumpTip)
///         - Adjustable minimum stake amount (existing deposits grandfathered with restrictions)
///         - Access control for stakers and allocation mechanisms
///         - Reward compounding (when REWARD_TOKEN == STAKE_TOKEN)
///         - Reward contribution to approved allocation mechanisms
///         - Admin controls (pause/unpause, config updates)
///
/// @dev WITHDRAWAL PROTECTION:
///      Users can always withdraw their staked tokens, even when the contract is paused.
///      The pause functionality affects all other operations (stake, claim, contribute, compound)
///      but explicitly excludes withdrawals to preserve user access to their principal funds.
///      This design ensures emergency pause can halt new deposits and reward operations while
///      maintaining user control over their staked assets at all times.
///
/// @dev CLAIMER PERMISSION MODEL:
///      Claimers are trusted entities designated by deposit owners with specific permissions:
///
///      Permission Matrix:
///      ┌─────────────────────────┬──────────┬─────────┐
///      │ Operation               │ Owner    │ Claimer │
///      ├─────────────────────────┼──────────┼─────────┤
///      │ Claim rewards           │ ✓        │ ✓       │
///      │ Compound rewards*†      │ ✓        │ ✓       │
///      │ Contribute to public‡   │ ✓        │ ✓       │

///      * Compounding increases deposit stake (intended behavior)
///      † Compounding requires deposit owner to pass stakerAccessMode checks (allowset/blockset enforcement)
///      ‡ Mechanism must be on allocationMechanismAllowset; contributor checked via mechanism's contributionAllowset
///      § VOTING POWER: The contributor (msg.sender) receives voting power in the allocation mechanism,
///         NOT the deposit owner. When a claimer contributes, the claimer gets voting power.
///
///      When designating a claimer, owners explicitly trust them with:
///      1. Claiming accrued rewards on their behalf
///      2. Compounding rewards to increase stake position (when REWARD_TOKEN == STAKE_TOKEN)
///      3. Contributing unclaimed rewards to approved allocation mechanisms
///      4. Receiving voting power in allocation mechanisms when they contribute (claimer gets voting power, not owner)
///
///      Security boundaries are maintained:
///      - Claimers cannot withdraw principal or rewards to arbitrary addresses
///      - Claimers cannot modify deposit parameters
///      - Owners can revoke claimer designation at any time via alterClaimer()
///
/// @notice Token requirements: STAKE_TOKEN and REWARD_TOKEN must be standard ERC-20 tokens.
///         Unsupported token behaviors include fee-on-transfer/deflationary mechanisms, rebasing,
///         or non-standard return values. Accounting assumes transferred amount equals requested
///         amount; non-standard tokens can break deposits, withdrawals, or reward accounting.
/// @dev Integer division causes ~1 wei precision loss, negligible due to SCALE_FACTOR (1e36).
/// @dev This base is abstract, with variants implementing token-specific behaviors (e.g., delegation surrogates).
/// @dev Earning power updates are required after balance changes; some are automatic, others via bumpEarningPower.
