 *
 *      DELEGATION MECHANISM:
 *      ═══════════════════════════════════
 *      1. User stakes tokens and specifies delegatee
 *      2. Contract deploys/fetches DelegationSurrogateVotes for that delegatee
 *      3. Tokens transferred to surrogate (not main contract)
 *      4. Surrogate automatically delegates voting power to delegatee
 *      5. Delegatee can use voting power in governance
 *      6. On unstake, tokens withdrawn from surrogate back to user
 *
 *      SURROGATE PATTERN:
 *      - One surrogate per delegatee (not per user)
 *      - Deployed on-demand via CREATE2 (deterministic addresses)
 *      - Surrogates are simple: hold tokens, delegate votes
 *      - Multiple users can share same surrogate (same delegatee)
 *
 *      GAS CONSIDERATIONS:
 *      - First use of delegatee: ~250k-350k gas (deploys surrogate)
 *      - Subsequent uses: ~100k gas (reuses existing surrogate)
 *      - Pre-deploy surrogates for common delegatees during low gas
 *
 *      WHEN TO USE:
 *      - Token: IERC20Staking (ERC20 + staking + delegation)
 *      - Need: Users want to delegate voting power while staked
 *      - Example: GLM token staking with governance delegation
 *
 *      WHEN NOT TO USE:
 *      - Token: Simple ERC20 (no voting)
 *      - Don't need delegation
 *      - Want to minimize gas costs
 *      → Use RegenStakerWithoutDelegateSurrogateVotes instead
 *
 *      SECURITY:
 *      - Surrogates deployed via CREATE2 (deterministic, verifiable)
 *      - Surrogates cannot be controlled by delegatee (just delegation target)
 *      - Tokens safe in surrogates (only contract can withdraw)
 *
 * @custom:security Surrogates deployed deterministically via CREATE2
 * @custom:origin https://github.com/ScopeLift/flexible-voting/blob/master/src/Staker.sol
