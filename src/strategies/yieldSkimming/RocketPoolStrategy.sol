 * @notice Yield skimming strategy for RocketPool rETH
 * @dev Captures yield from rETH appreciation by tracking rETH/ETH exchange rate
 *
 *      ROCKETPOOL MECHANISM:
 *      - rETH represents staked ETH in RocketPool protocol
 *      - Exchange rate: rETH → ETH increases as staking rewards accrue
 *      - Rate starts at ~1.0 and increases over time
 *      - Different from Lido: non-rebasing, rate appreciation only
 *
 *      YIELD CAPTURE:
 *      - User deposits 100 rETH at rate 1.0
 *      - Rate increases to 1.05 (5% staking rewards)
 *      - Vault value: 105 ETH
 *      - Profit: Strategy shares worth 5 ETH value minted to dragon router
 *
 *      EXCHANGE RATE SOURCE:
 *      - Calls RocketPool.getExchangeRate()
 *      - Based on RocketPool's accounting
 *      - Cannot be manipulated
 *      - 18 decimal precision
 *
 * @custom:security Exchange rate from RocketPool (trusted source)
 * @custom:security Slashing risk: Validators can be slashed, affecting rate
