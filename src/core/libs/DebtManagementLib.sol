/**
 * @title DebtManagementLib
 * @author yearn.finance; extracted as library by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @custom:ported-from https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults-v3/blob/master/contracts/VaultV3.vy
 * @notice Library for managing debt allocation and rebalancing between a multistrategy vault and its strategies
 * @dev This library handles the complex logic of moving assets between the vault's idle reserves and
 *      individual strategies to maintain target debt levels. It ensures proper accounting, respects
 *      minimum idle requirements, and handles loss scenarios during withdrawals.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Debt rebalancing: Moves assets to/from strategies to match target debt allocations
 * - Loss protection: Enforces maximum acceptable loss thresholds during withdrawals
 * - Idle management: Maintains minimum idle reserves in the vault for liquidity
 * - Strategy constraints: Respects individual strategy deposit/withdrawal limits
 * - Shutdown handling: Ensures controlled wind-down when vault is in shutdown mode
 *
 * The library follows the ERC4626 standard for strategy interactions and implements
 * robust error handling for edge cases like insufficient liquidity or unrealized losses.
 *
 * Originally part of Yearn V3 Multistrategy Vault (Vyper), extracted to separate library
 * due to Solidity contract size limitations.

     *      OPERATION MODES:
     *      ═══════════════════════════════════
     *      1. REDUCE DEBT (targetDebt < currentDebt):
     *         - Withdraws assets from strategy back to vault
     *         - Increases totalIdle, decreases totalDebt
     *         - Respects strategy's maxRedeem limit
     *         - Validates loss within maxLoss tolerance
     *         - Ensures minimumTotalIdle is maintained
     *
     *      2. INCREASE DEBT (targetDebt > currentDebt):
     *         - Deposits idle assets from vault to strategy
     *         - Decreases totalIdle, increases totalDebt
     *         - Respects strategy's maxDeposit limit
     *         - Respects strategy's maxDebt cap
     *         - Ensures minimumTotalIdle is preserved
     *
     *      SPECIAL VALUES:
     *      - targetDebt = type(uint256).max: Deposit all available idle (up to maxDebt)
     *      - targetDebt = 0: Withdraw all assets from strategy
     *
     *      SAFETY CHECKS:
     *      - Prevents withdrawals if unrealized losses exist
     *      - Uses actual balance diff for precise accounting
     *      - Validates losses within maxLoss tolerance
     *      - Maintains minimumTotalIdle buffer
     *      - Auto-shutdown: Forces targetDebt = 0 if vault shutdown
     *
     *      LOSS HANDLING:
     *      - maxLoss in basis points (0-10000)
     *      - Loss = (assetsToWithdraw - actuallyWithdrawn)
     *      - Reverts if loss exceeds tolerance
     *      - Common values: 0 (no loss), 100 (1%), 10000 (100%)
     *
     * @param strategies Storage mapping of strategy parameters
     * @param totalIdle Current vault idle assets
     * @param totalDebt Current total debt across all strategies
     * @param strategy Strategy address to rebalance
     * @param targetDebt Target debt for strategy, or type(uint256).max for max
     * @param maxLoss Maximum acceptable loss in basis points (0-10000)
     * @param minimumTotalIdle Minimum idle to maintain in vault
     * @param asset Vault's asset token address
     * @param isShutdown Whether vault is shutdown (forces withdrawals)
     * @return result Updated debt, totalIdle, and totalDebt values
