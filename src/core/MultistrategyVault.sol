/**
 * @title MultistrategyVault
 * @author yearn.finance; port maintained by [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @custom:ported-from https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults-v3/blob/master/contracts/VaultV3.vy
 * @notice This MultistrategyVault is based on the original VaultV3.vy Vyper implementation
 *   that has been ported to Solidity. It is designed as a non-opinionated system
 *   to distribute funds of depositors for a specific `asset` into different
 *   opportunities (aka Strategies) and manage accounting in a robust way.
 *
 *   Depositors receive shares (aka vaults tokens) proportional to their deposit amount.
 *   Vault tokens are yield-bearing and can be redeemed at any time to get back deposit
 *   plus any yield generated.
 *
 *   Addresses that are given different permissioned roles by the `roleManager`
 *   are then able to allocate funds as they best see fit to different strategies
 *   and adjust the strategies and allocations as needed, as well as reporting realized
 *   profits or losses.
 *
 *   Strategies are any ERC-4626 compliant contracts that use the same underlying `asset`
 *   as the vault. The vault provides no assurances as to the safety of any strategy
 *   and it is the responsibility of those that hold the corresponding roles to choose
 *   and fund strategies that best fit their desired specifications.
 *
 *   Those holding vault tokens are able to redeem the tokens for the corresponding
 *   amount of underlying asset based on any reported profits or losses since their
 *   initial deposit.
 *
 *   The vault is built to be customized by the management to be able to fit their
 *   specific desired needs. Including the customization of strategies, accountants,
 *   ownership etc.
 *
 * @dev Security considerations (summary):
 *  - Roles: privileged functions gated via `Roles`; improper assignment can lead to fund mismanagement.
 *  - Reentrancy: mutating flows guarded by `nonReentrant`.
 *  - Precision/rounding: use preview/convert helpers; PPS exposed has limited precision.
 *  - Withdrawal queue: incorrect ordering/duplicates can distort maxWithdraw/maxRedeem views.
 *  - Strategy trust: vault does not attest to strategy safety; management must curate strategies.

     *      PROCESS OVERVIEW:
     *      1. Calculate gain/loss by comparing strategy assets vs recorded debt
     *      2. Assess fees and refunds via accountant (if set)
     *      3. Calculate shares to burn (for losses/fees) and shares to lock (for profits)

     *      5. Pull refunds from accountant if any
     *      6. Update strategy debt tracking
     *      7. Issue fee shares to accountant and protocol
     *      8. Update profit unlocking rate and schedule
     *
     *      IMPORTANT NOTES:
     *      - Strategy's convertToAssets() MUST NOT be manipulable or vault reports incorrect gains/losses
     *      - Pass address(this) as strategy_ to accrue airdrops into totalIdle
     *      - Profit locking prevents PPS manipulation by gradually releasing profits over time
     *      - Fees are taken as shares, reducing profit for existing shareholders
     *
     *      ACCOUNTING INVARIANTS:
     *      - totalAssets = totalIdle + totalDebt
     *      - totalSupply = circulating shares + locked shares
