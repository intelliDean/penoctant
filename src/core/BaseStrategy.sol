/**
 * @title Octant Base Strategy
 * @author [Golem Foundation](https://golem.foundation)
 * @custom:security-contact security@golem.foundation
 * @notice BaseStrategy implements all of the required functionality to
 *  seamlessly integrate with the `TokenizedStrategy` implementation contract
 *  allowing anyone to easily build a fully permissionless ERC-4626 compliant
 *  Vault by inheriting this contract and overriding three simple functions.

 *  It utilizes an immutable proxy pattern that allows the BaseStrategy
 *  to remain simple and small. All standard logic is held within the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy` and is reused over any n strategies all using the
 *  `fallback` function to delegatecall the implementation so that strategists
 *  can only be concerned with writing their strategy specific code.
 *
 *  This contract should be inherited and the three main abstract methods
 *  `_deployFunds`, `_freeFunds` and `_harvestAndReport` implemented to adapt
 *  the Strategy to the particular needs it has to generate yield. There are
 *  other optional methods that can be implemented to further customize
 *  the strategy if desired.
 *
 *  All default storage for the strategy is controlled and updated by the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy`. The implementation holds a storage struct that
 *  contains all needed global variables in a manual storage slot. This
 *  means strategists can feel free to implement their own custom storage
 *  variables as they need with no concern of collisions. All global variables
 *  can be viewed within the Strategy by a simple call using the
 *  `TokenizedStrategy` variable. IE: TokenizedStrategy.globalVariable();.

     *      - Allow final report to realize remaining positions
